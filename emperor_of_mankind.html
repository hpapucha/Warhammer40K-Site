            <h1 class="display-2">THE EMPEROR OF MANKIND</h1><hr>
 
            <p><strong>The Emperor of Mankind</strong> is the immortal Perpetual who serves as the ruling monarch of the Imperium of Man, and is described by the Imperial Ecclesiarchy and the Imperial Cult as the Father, Guardian and God of humanity. 
                The Chaos Gods and the daemons of the Warp refer to Him as "the Anathema" for He is the greatest embodiment of universal Order in the galaxy today. He has sat immobile, his body slowly crumbling, within the Golden Throne of Terra for over 10,000 standard years. 
                Although once a living man, His shattered, decaying body can no longer support life, and it is kept intact only by the cybernetic mechanisms of the Golden Throne and a potent mind itself sustained by the daily sacrifice of thousands of lives.
            </p> 
            <img src="images/emperor_of_man/emperormain.jpg" alt="emperormainimage"></a>
            <p>The Emperor chose to sacrifice His immortal life at the end of the Horus Heresy in the service and protection of Mankind. 
                To humanity's countless trillions across the galaxy-spanning Imperium, He is nothing less than God. 
            Through his Imperium, Mankind is united and remains one of the most powerful intelligent races in the Milky Way Galaxy as well as its most dominant in terms of both population and territory held. United under one government, 
                Mankind is able to survive the myriad deadly threats it faces from aliens, the Forces of Chaos and the Traitors, Heretics and mutants that lie within the Imperium's boundaries. 
            </p>

            </figure>
            
        </div>
            <p>The Imperium's rule, carried on in the Emperor's name since the end of the Horus Heresy by the High Lords of Terra and a multitude of Imperial organisations, has been long, oppressive and necessarily harsh. 
                It has also resulted in technological and cultural stagnation, and a regression into tyranny, superstition and religious obfuscation and intolerance that would have horrified the Emperor.
                Though He is no longer responsive to external stimuli, the Emperor still lies at the very heart of the Imperium's continued existence. 
                Although He cannot be directly involved in the day-to-day running of humanity's galactic government. His existence on the Golden Throne is vital to sustaining the Imperium, since His powerful mind's presence in the Immaterium maintains and directs the
                Astronomican, the psychic beacon that makes possible faster-than-light Warp travel and is vital to Imperial shipping, transportation, commerce and communication. 
            </p>
          
            <p>
                 He is said to still guide His race through the psychically-reactive divination tool known as the Emperor's Tarot, which select psykers can consult to gain a glimpse of the 
                 future and the Emperor's will. He is also said to constantly battle the Chaos Gods in the Warp and prevent their further intrusion upon the material universe. His mind must remain 
                 vigilant at all times throughout the entire Imperium to safeguard the human race and to offer His protection to the faithful. Above all else, it is Mankind's collective belief in the Emperor's divinity 
                 that serves as its greatest protection from Chaos and the other hideous dangers that plague the galaxy. 
            </p> 
            </p> As the Imperial Creed has taught for over 10,000 standard years, the Emperor protects...</p>
            <br><br>

            <h1 class="display-2">Origins</h1><hr>
            <p><strong>The Emperor</strong> is the collective reincarnation of all the shamans of Neolithic Humanity's various peoples, the first Human psykers. 
            The foul Warp entities that would become the four Great Powers of Chaos had not yet fully formed when the Emperor was born on Earth 
            during prehistoric times, somewhere in ancient central Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 8th Millennium B.C.
            But even before the birth of the Emperor, as Humanity grew and progressed, the Warp began to become increasingly disturbed by the dark 
            undercurrents of Humanity's collective psyche, and the shamans began to lose their former ability to reincarnate into new bodies. Instead, upon 
            dying, their souls were consumed by the entities and daemons of the Warp.
            </p>
        <div class="col-six tab-full">

            </figure>
        </div>
            <p>
                Eventually the shamans of Humanity, unable to reincarnate, would become extinct, and without the shamans and their psychic abilities to guide the race, 
                Humanity would inevitably fall prey to the corruptions of Chaos, just as eventually happened to the Aeldari. In these ancient days, all the shamans of 
                Earth gathered in a grand conclave to decide what must be done to stave off the day when they had all been consumed by the Warp.
                In the end, the shamans decided to pool their collective psychic energies by reincarnating as a single soul in a single Human body to create an individual 
                they called "the New Man." The thousands of shamans, as one, took poison, and as one, they died, their souls flowing into the Immaterium in a rush of psychic 
                power that overwhelmed those daemons who sought to feast upon it with a cleansing, purifying fire, a flame imperishable that became one soul out of many.

            <h1 class="display-2">Rise of the Emperor and the Great Crusade  </h1><hr>
        <p>
            <strong>The man</strong> who would later become known as the Emperor of Mankind first appears in Imperial records as just one of the many warlords struggling for 
            control of Terra during the later part of the Age of Strife in the 30th Millennium. The Emperor undertook a series of military campaigns against 
            all the other warlords on the planet that would collectively later become known as the Unification Wars. During these conflicts the Emperor employed 
            several military formations -- such as the genetically-altered warriors of the unit designated Geno 5-2 Chiliad who would go on to serve in the 
            Imperial Army -- that consisted of using genetically-enhanced warriors to maximise His tactical prowess. The most powerful of these troops were the 
            proto-Astartes known as the Thunder Warriors. These warriors played a significant role in the Emperor's eventual victory over all the other warlords 
            of Terra and led Him to believe that His future plans to reunite Mankind would require the creation of an even more potent core of genetically-engineered 
            military commanders and warriors. Following the Battle of Mount Ararat in the Kingdom of Urartu, which was the last battle of the Unification Wars, the 
            Unity of Terra was at last achieved after decades of blood, loss and fire. With this victory, the planet and population of Terra were at last unified under 
            the single rule of the Emperor. But to make His dream of reuniting all of Mankind within a single galaxy-spanning empire possible, the Emperor knew that He 
            would have to make some difficult, even immoral decisions.    
        </p>

            </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
            The Emperor next set in motion His plan to defend and better Mankind across the galaxy, by unifying those lost bastions of humanity 
            scattered across the myriad stars under the aegis of the newborn Imperium. This extraordinary undertaking would become known as the Great Crusade.   
            The Emperor prepared extensively for the Great Crusade in the years after Unity was achieved on Terra; He created the special astro-telepath (Astropath) 
            corps to link his eventual interstellar dominion together through the use of telepathy, and engineered the creation of the Astronomican, a supremely 
            powerful psychic navigational beacon powered by the Emperor's own will and psychic abilities that would allow simplified and safer interstellar travel 
            through the Warp across far greater distances than before. Chief amongst His designs, however, was the creation of new legions of superhuman, genetically-
            engineered warriors, the logical extension of the gene-troopers already under his command, though they would be far superior to the gene-enhanced troops of the 
            Imperial Army He had used during the Unification Wars. The Emperor first undertook the Primarch Project, the creation of 20 superhuman infants whose genomes had 
            been designed using His own genetic code as the foundation, who were intended to mature into powerful generals and statesmen for His armies. The Primarchs would 
            be beings of such great mental and physical superiority that nothing merely human could stand against them.
        <p>To enhance the Primarchs beyond the capabilities that even genetic-engineering allowed, however, the Emperor also drew upon the powers of the Warp he had 
            learned at Molech to enhance His creations, imbuing them with nearly godlike levels of charisma and capability, but also unintentionally making them susceptible 
            to corruption by the entities of the Warp. However, this plan went awry with the intervention of the Ruinous Powers, who feared that the Emperor's plans might 
            succeed too well, vastly increasing the hold of Order over the universe and diminishing their own strength. It is for this reason that all of daemonkind refers 
            to the Emperor as "the Anathema." While accounts vary as to exactly what happened, the end of the tale is always the same; the Primarchs were cast into the Warp 
            in their gestation chambers from beneath the Himalazian (Himalaya) Mountains in the Emperor's gene-labs despite the multiple psychic wards the Emperor had laid 
            down upon the laboratory, and thought lost. In the aftermath of these events, the Emperor conceived a new plan. Using genetic samples that had been derived from the
             Primarchs' genomes, He created a caste of warriors who would possess some of the same superhuman qualities of the Primarchs and Himself. These successors to the 
             genetically-enhanced human warriors of the Unification Wars-era were the Legiones Astartes, the Space Marine Legions of the First Founding.
        </p> 
        <p>After their creation, the Emperor led the 20 Space Marine Legions, all of their Astartes originally recruited from Terran-born males, in their first missions to 
            give them experience in war and diplomacy through the reconquest of the rest of the Solar System. The Space Marines drove alien slavers from the moons of Saturn and 
            Jupiter and most importantly, achieved peace and the eventual integration of Imperial Terra with the Cult Mechanicum of Mars. This crucial military and political 
            alliance, formalised in the 30th Millennium with the signing of the Treaty of Mars, provided the Emperor with much of the technological means and materiel required to 
            extend His crusade into the stars. At the same time, the alliance formalised the creation of the Imperium of Man and established the Imperial bureaucracy on Terra, 
            transforming the Cult Mechanicum into the Adeptus Mechanicus, one of the myriad organisations that comprised the newborn Adeptus Terra, the massive government of the
             Imperium, the future Priesthood of Earth.      
        </p>
        <p>With the final abatement of the Warp Storms caused by the birth-pangs of the Chaos God Slaanesh and ended by the Fall of the Eldar, the Emperor finally 
            began the Great Crusade at the end of the 30th Millennium. The Emperor's forces, concentrated amongst a rapidly growing cadre of Expeditionary Fleets, 
            rediscovered long-lost human colony worlds, cast out alien oppressors, and claimed vast new territories for the newborn Imperium to exploit across the 
            galaxy. Perhaps most importantly, the Emperor, leading His Crusade, rediscovered His lost sons, the Primarchs, as the Expeditionary Fleets pushed out 
            deeper into the depths of unexplored space. Scattered across the galaxy, the Primarchs were found one-by-one, over a period of many decades, and reunited 
            with their father and their own genetic sons in the Space Marine Legions. All were placed in command of the Astartes Legions created from their respective 
            gene-seed and played a major part in forging their father's Imperium. Together they brought thousands of worlds into Imperial Compliance, establishing the 
            rule of the Imperium over these worlds and inculcating in them the values of the Imperial Truth -- a rationalist, atheistic faith in science and technological 
            progress that rejected all the vestiges of human irrationality and superstition, including all forms of religious faith
        </p>  

        <h1 class="display-2">Imperial Webway Project</h1><hr>
        <p><strong>Well over</strong> a standard century into the Great Crusade, the Emperor decided to return to Terra to oversee a special project 
            that He intended to cap His ambitions for humanity. This was the secret Webway Project, in which the Emperor planned to 
            use a special artefact from the Dark Age of Technology -- the Golden Throne -- that had been discovered on Terra beneath 
            a huge and inhospitable desert on the continent of Asia. The Emperor planned to use the Golden Throne to enter and reshape 
            the Labyrinthine Dimension of the Eldar Webway to serve as a direct and instantaneous transport network between all the 
            worlds of the Imperium. This human Webway would recreate the vast network of Warp Portals that had once bound together 
            the Old Ones' and the Eldar's ancient interstellar empires and would allow Mankind to advance at a more rapid rate, 
            scientifically and economically, than at any other time in its history. The Webway was a far more efficient means of 
            travel, and most importantly bypassed the depredations of Chaos within the Warp that represented a constant hazard of 
            death or corruption to human faster-than-light space travel. The ultimate objective of the Webway Project was for the 
            Emperor to completely sever humanity from the need for the Warp in its entirety, further depriving Chaos of its power to 
            corrupt and destroy. This would come as the Emperor guided the species in its evolution into a fully psychic race, assuring 
            its ascendancy on the galactic stage beyond what even the lost Eldar Empire had once managed to achieve. A human-dominated 
            Webway would also truly unite the Imperium, preventing Mankind from ever again being divided by time and great distance. But this 
            project would require all of His considerable attention and had to be pursued in secret, lest the Eldar or other opponents of the 
            project learn of it and seek to stop it before the Emperor's efforts could come to fruition.
        <div class="col-six tab-full">
                <figure>
                <img src="images/emperor_of_man/warp.jpg" alt="warpimage"></a>
                <figcaption>The Emperor of Mankind before his internment within the Golden Throne.</figcaption>
                </figure>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Golden Throne had been built during the Dark Age of Technology to allow human access to the Eldar Webway and took the form of a 
            heavily mechanised throne created from an unknown type of psychically-reactive gold-complected alloy that was suspended over a pair 
            of massive doors composed of the same golden alloy. These doors acted as the portal to the Webway and were supposedly large enough 
            for a Warhound-class Scout Titan to walk through upright. The Golden Throne was originally located in the depths of the Imperial 
            Palace where the Emperor's original gene-laboratory complex had once stood, an area known as the Imperial Dungeon. Hundreds of red-robed 
            Adeptus Mechanicus Tech-priests and Servitors toiled in the Imperial Dungeon, as the Emperor sat upon the Golden Throne and used His immense 
            powers to hold the portal into the Webway open for His workers, who constructed a new section of the Labyrinthine Dimension intended to connect 
            Terra to the rest of the largely abandoned Eldar transdimensional transport network. Because the Webway had been constructed from a psychically-
            resistant material intended to protect it from penetration by the entities of the Warp, and Mankind did not possess the technology required to 
            replicate it, the Emperor had to personally shield the new human-built sections of the Webway from Warp incursions. This required him to remain on the 
            Golden Throne continuously and was the reason why He had been forced to leave the Great Crusade in the hands of His Primarchs and return to Terra to oversee the project personally. 
        </p>
        <h1 class="display-2">Horus Heresy</h1><hr>
        <p>
            <strong>This turn </strong>of events did not please all of the Emperor's subjects, several of His Primarch sons in particular. In the final stages of the 
            Great Crusade, the Emperor's most trusted son Horus succumbed to the temptations of Chaos. This seduction had been set in place over long 
            decades by the Primarch Lorgar and his Word Bearers Legion. Althought the Horus Heresy lasted mere seven years it is heavily documented and highly detailed.  
        </p>
        <p>
        As a result, as the Horus Heresy reached its climax with the Traitors' assault on Terra itself seven standard years after the 
        start of the Warmaster's drive on the Throneworld, the Emperor was forced to remain on the Golden Throne at all times save for the 
        few moments when Malcador the Sigillite, the Regent of Terra and the second strongest human psyker, could take His place.
        Emp vs Horus Battle Terra
        The Emperor and Horus unleash their potent psychic abilities against each other aboard the Warmaster's flagship, Vengeful Spirit.
        When the Emperor learned of Horus' action in lowering his flagship the Vengeful Spirit's Void Shields during the final hours of the 
        Siege of Terra, He realised that His treacherous son was actually offering an invitation to battle. The Emperor believed He had to tak
        e the war to Horus to put an end to the terrible conflict once and for all.  
        He had Malcador the Sigillite take his place upon the Golden Throne to protect Terra from a daemonic assault and 
        prepared a strike team of Astartes to face the Warmaster on his own ground. The last act of the bloody treachery 
        of the Horus Heresy was played out above Terra, as the Emperor led a desperate assault of Imperial Fists and Blood 
        Angels Space Marines against Horus' Chaos-corrupted flagship, using teleporter technology to make their way aboard.

        <p>
        The two champions engaged one another in a tragic battle of father and son, as Horus mortally wounded the Emperor, tearing off 
        one of His arms and shattering His internal organs, largely because the Emperor still loved Horus and could not bring Himself to use the full extent of His psychic abilities to destroy His son.
        With iron resolve, the Emperor gathered the full strength of His mind at last and delivered a massive psychic attack through the chink in Warmaster's Terminator Armour that 
        killed Horus almost instantly and obliterated his very soul from the Warp so that the Chaos Gods could not resurrect their champion. 
        In his final moments before the Emperor unleashed His final attack to blot Horus' soul from existence, the corrupting powers of Chaos briefly relinquished their 
        hold on the Warmaster's soul and the Emperor sensed the
         return of His son's sanity in the seconds before his consciousness was utterly obliterated.
        </p>
        
        
        <p>It was in this battered and bleeding state that the Emperor was found by Rogal Dorn, the Primarch of the Imperial Fists Legion who had accompanied the 
        assault force onto the Vengeful Spirit. Dorn returned with the Emperor to the Imperial Palace, where Malcador the Sigillite simply crumbled to ash upon 
        relinquishing his place upon the Golden Throne. The Sigillite's body and mind had been burned out by the strain of holding the Golden Throne's portal 
        closed for the time that the Emperor had been aboard the Warmaster's flagship.
        The dying Emperor quickly dictated plans to Dorn for the modification of the Golden Throne into an arcane life support machine that would sustain His 
        remaining cells in an undying state between life and true death for over ten thousand Terran years, and He was subsequently interred in this altered 
        version of the Golden Throne.
        The throne's mechanisms would also allow the Emperor to maintain the beacon of the Astronomican and battle the influence of the Chaos Gods in the Warp 
        so long as His mind was empowered and sustained with the psychic energies of 1,000 psykers every day, preventing a daemonic incursion on Terra and 
        helping to sustain Mankind against Chaos' corruptive influence throughout the galaxy.
        His strength rapidly failing, the Emperor had only enough time to give His final, brief instructions to Rogal Dorn before the Golden Throne's modified 
        mechanisms were activated and He was placed within an unending stasis for more than 10,000 standard years. Only His mind remained active within the Warp 
        as His dying body continued to decay at a glacially slow pace. 
        </p>
        <h1 class="display-2">At Present</h1><hr>
        
        <p><strong>As mentioned</strong>, the Emperor's shattered and mortally-wounded body was discovered on the bridge of the Vengeful Spirit by 
        the Primarch of the Imperial Fists, Rogal Dorn, who, following the Emperor's instructions, oversaw His internment within the 
        Golden Throne, the arcane device modified at the Emperor's own direction to sustain His mind and decaying body.
        The Imperial Cult, after its establishment as the state religion of the Imperium in the 32nd Millennium, would later claim that this internment within the Golden 
        Throne had been necessary so that the Emperor could leave the physical plane behind and "ascend" once more to His proper place in the Immaterium as the one, true 
        God of Mankind after sacrificing Himself to save humanity from the Traitor Horus.
        The Emperor has remained in the Golden Throne since His "ascension" to this day, neither fully living nor wholly dead. Although the device was initially intended 
        to be used as the nexus of the Emperor's secret project to utilise the Aeldari Webway for the good of humanity, the Golden Throne also now functions as a complex

        </div>
        life support device and psychic amplifier, projecting the Emperor's mind into the Warp and across the galaxy.
        The Golden Throne itself lies in the Sanctum Imperialis, the great hall at the heart of the Imperial Palace guarded by the Emperor's Companions, a special and 
        highly elite bodyguard contingent of the Adeptus Custodes.
        The Emperor's decaying physical form is preserved by the vast arcane machinery of the Golden Throne, which itself is maintained by a legion of Tech-priests from the 
        Adeptus Mechanicus. His psychic essence is spread out across the whole of the galaxy through the Warp, watching over as much of humanity as He can manage in His 
        current depleted state, in order to keep the Ruinous Powers at bay.
        The Golden Throne is also connected to a massive psychic beacon known as the Astronomican, which makes faster than light travel possible for Imperial starships 
        outfitted with a Warp-Drive by generating a telepathic signal by which the specialised mutant psykers known as Navigators are able to navigate through Warpspace.
        The Astronomican signal is originated and directed by the Emperor's mind, but is amplified and powered by a choir of 10,000 human psykers. These individuals are 
        selected for their psychic prowess, their ability to control their power, and are put to the task only after undergoing a rigorous process that includes their soul-binding 
        to the Emperor to strengthen their minds against possession by daemonic entities.
        </p>

        <figcaption>The mummified body of the Carrion King of Mankind.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        The life force of these psykers is consumed over the course of several solar months, 1,000 of whom die every day, which means that replacements must 
        constantly be found and brought to Terra aboard the infamous Black Ships of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica, the Imperial organisation responsible for 
        regulating humans who possess the psychic mutation.
        The selected psykers are, for the most part, indoctrinated to accept their fate as their sacred duty for the Imperium, for they are too dangerous to 
        those around them to be allowed to live, and the sacrifice of their life is the greatest good that they can do in service to the God-Emperor.
        Those who prove less willing to give themselves for the glorious cause of Mankind are sedated and their psychic lifeforce fed to the power collection 
        mechanism of the Golden Throne regardless. The Imperium must survive, regardless of the daily cost in lives. 
        It is said that the Emperor's existence is one of endless pain and suffering, and that it is only His utter devotion to the human race that keeps Him 
        from accepting the death He now desperately longs to embrace. Should the Emperor die, then the Astronomican will become useless, and humanity will no 
        longer be able to safely travel through the Warp using its current technology (although this may be disputed by the fact that humanity traveled the stars 
        before the Emperor sat upon the Golden Throne, during the Dark Age of Technology).
