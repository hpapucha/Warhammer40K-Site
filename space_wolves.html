            <hr>
            <p><strong>The Space Wolves</strong>, known in their own dialect of Juvjk as the Vlka Fenryka or "Wolves of Fenris," were once led by their famed Primarch, Leman Russ. Originally the VI Legion of Astartes 
                raised by the Emperor at the dawn of the Great Crusade, the Space Wolves are renowned for their anti-authoritarian ways and their embrace of their 
                homeworld Fenris' savage barbarian culture as well as their extreme deviation from the Codex Astartes in the Chapter's organisation.

            <p>
                <strong>Leman Russ</strong>, also known as the "Wolf King" and the "Great Wolf" during his lifetime, is the currently missing Primarch of the Space Wolves Chapter of Space Marines.
                He led the Space Wolves Space Marine Legion during the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy and is famed in Imperial history for his hatred of psychic powers and sorcery, 
                whose use in battle he viewed as dishonourable and unworthy of true warriors.
                After receiving a disturbing vision in 211.M31, Leman Russ disappeared with the warriors of his Varagyr bodyguard, his destination and fate unknown.          
                Russ, along with his brother Primarchs Angron and Vulkan, were considered to be the greatest warriors one-on-one amongst the Primarchs. Known for his fierce and sometimes 
                barbaric personality, Leman Russ considered himself the Emperor of Mankind's most loyal son and executioner.                
                
            </p>    
            <p>He viewed his role as unquestionably carrying out the punishments requited by the Master of Mankind. Among the forces of Chaos he was known as "the Brawler."
                Some recent rumours claim that it is Leman Russ who is the unknown force behind the return of the Space Wolves' 13th Company to realspace after 10,000 Terran years fighting the 
                forces of Chaos in the Warp during the 13th Black Crusade of 999.M41.
                Several main battle tank variants used by the Astra Militarum have been named after him. The Leman Russ tank is the most prominent, and several sub-variants of that pattern of 
                tank also exist in widespread use in the Imperium of Man, such as the Leman Russ Demolisher.

            <p><strong>The Space Wolves</strong>, known in their own dialect of Juvjk as the Vlka Fenryka or "Wolves of Fenris," are one of the original 20 First Founding Space 
                Marine Chapters, and were once led by their famed Primarch, Leman Russ. Originally the VI Legion of Astartes raised by the Emperor at the dawn 
                of the Great Crusade, the Space Wolves are renowned for their anti-authoritarian ways and their embrace of their homeworld Fenris' savage barbarian 
                culture as well as their extreme deviation from the Codex Astartes in the Chapter's organisation.
                After the Horus Heresy and the resultant Second Founding reforms of the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Wolves Legion was divided into two Chapters: 
                the new Space Wolves Chapter, which was not compliant with the dictates of the Codex Astartes and retained the name of its parent Legion, and the second 
                Chapter which took the name of the Wolf Brothers. The Wolf Brothers suffered from rampant mutation of their gene-seed not long after their Founding and were 
                later disbanded. It is currently unknown if there are any other Successor Chapters of the Space Wolves in the Imperium. 
            </p> 
            <figure>
            <img src="legions/sixth-space-wolves/wolves2.png" alt="spacewolvestwo"></a>
            <figcaption>A Space Wolf Marine on the homeworld of Fenris</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Since the Imperium came into being, the Space Wolves have fought tooth and nail for the cause of the Emperor. Amongst the most famous of the Chapters of the 
                Adeptus Astartes, their sagas are told from one end of the galaxy to the other. As headstrong as they are fierce, the Space Wolves excel at close-quarters 
                fighting, their warriors vying keenly for glory on the field of battle. The Space Wolves live to fight, and death holds no fear for them.
                The legends of the Space Wolves Chapter are told on countless thousands of worlds, and like the greatest of their fellow First Founding kin, they hold so many 
                battle-honours that it would take a battle-scribe an entire lifetime to commit them all to parchment. The manner in which such laurels are won and recounted amongst the 
                Space Wolves is very different to how such things are achieved amongst other Chapters.
                The Space Wolves are savage and proud, and they seek glory in all they do. Some, especially the Dark Angels, regard the Sons of Russ as braggarts and gloryhounds, 
                finding their methods crude and their desire to make a name for themselves vainglorious. In truth, every Space Wolves Battle-Brother longs for his story -- his saga -- to be 
                recounted by his kin long after he has fallen, and for his name to be spoken in the same breath as the Primarch himself.

            <p>
                The Space Wolves deviate from the Codex Astartes and the essential nature of what it is to be a Space Marine about as far as is possible. 
                Their genetic inheritance is at once a blessing and a curse, for although each Space Wolf is gifted of the superhuman senses of Russ himself, 
                their enhanced physiologies can be overcome by the change and mutation can occur.
                In organisation, the Chapter has never paid any regard to the dictates of Roboute Guilliman's Codex Astartes, stubbornly cleaving to the structure that saw it through the 
                wars at the dawn of the Age of the Imperium. In appearance, the Space Wolves are savage and wild, adorning their armour with a combination of finely-wrought talismans and 
                skins, bones, and teeth taken as trophies from beasts they have slain in single combat. Even in their manners, the Battle-Brothers of the Space Wolves differ from most other 
                Space Marines, for they are competitive and headstrong, and at once individualistic and fiercely loyal to their "Pack."</p>
            <p> Space Wolves seek to write their saga with every deed they perform and every battle they fight, and perhaps more than any other Chapter, their service is an epic in itself. 
                The rites of initiation that a Space Wolf must undergo in order to be accepted as a Neophyte are amongst the most harsh of any Chapter. Often he must actually fall in combat 
                having slain all of his foes first, a guttering spark of life remaining. His deeds witnessed by a so-called "Chooser of the Slain," the young warrior awakens far from his tribe. 
                But this is only the beginning, for so potent is the gene-stock of Russ that most who receive it are overcome, their bodies ravaged by mutation as they transform into savage
                 beasts called Wulfen.
                Those who can contain this animal potency are judged fit to proceed, and after countless more trials may be accepted into the ranks of the Blood Claw Assault Packs. At this 
                stage in his life, a Space Wolf is likely to be a headstrong berserker competing with his peers for the approval of his superiors. He is also full of the disdain and reckless 
                overconfdence of youth, convinced that his methods are correct and the older warriors are simply stuck in their ways. Only as he matures with experience, faces more foes and 
                suffers the cathartic tragedy of losing beloved Battle-Brothers does he change, and progress to join the Grey Hunter Packs.
