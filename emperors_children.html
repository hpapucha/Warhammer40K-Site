                <hr>
            <p><strong>The Emperor's Children</strong>, also sometimes known after their fall as the Lords of Profligacy, are a Traitor Legion of Chaos Space Marines who devote 
                themselves solely to the service of the Chaos God Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure, though they were originally the Imperium of Man's proud IIIrd Legion of Astartes
            </p> 
            <h1 class="display-2">Primarch Fulgrim</h1>

            </figure>
            <p>
                <strong>Fulgrim,</strong> also known in the time before the Horus Heresy as The Phoenician, is the Primarch of the Emperor's Children Traitor Legion. He possessed silvery-white 
                hair and was quite vainglorious, as his entire life was dedicated to the pursuit of perfection in all things; physical, mental and spiritual. Today, Fulgrim is 
                a four-armed, serpentine Daemon Prince of Slaanesh who is believed to reside on a Daemon World somewhere within the Eye of Terror.           
            </p>    
            <p>Unknown to almost everyone, including his own remaining Chaos Space Marines, Fulgrim expressed remorse, repenting his corruption by the Ruinous Powers during 
                the Drop Site Massacre on Istvaan V during the opening days of the Horus Heresy nearly ten millennia ago. A Greater Daemon of Slaanesh took advantage of this 
                weakness to possess his body for a time, but Fulgrim used his spiritual imprisonment to further explore the power of Chaos and eventually turned the tables on 
                the daemon and forced it into an imprisonment of its own to regain control of his body. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                Fulgrim emerged from that experience even more committed to the pursuit of the path of sensation offered by Slaanesh and Chaos, and before the Horus 
                Heresy had ended he was rewarded for his devotion with ascension to become a Daemon Prince of the God of Pleasure. His current exact location remains 
                unknown to the Imperium and the majority of the Heretic Astartes of the Emperor's Children Traitor Legion who still wander the galaxy in pursuit of their 
                own pleasure and ascension.

                devote themselves solely to the service of the Chaos God Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure, though they were originally the Imperium of Man's

             <p>The Emperor's Children was the only Space Marine Legion to bear the Emperor's own name and His own icon -- the Palatine Aquila -- granted to 
                them by His hand as a symbol of the Legion's martial perfection. Few were ever so honoured amongst the ancient Space Marine Legions and given 
                less cause to betray the Master of Mankind than the Emperor's Children. Given the plaudits and accolades accorded them, few could doubt that they 
                were the embodiment of what the Emperor had intended the Legiones Astartes to be: noble in action and aspect, excelling in all matters, 
                strong, civilised, firm of purpose and loyal to the core.
            </p> 

            <p>
                From this height they descended in treachery to the lowest and vilest of creatures, enslaved to pride and consumed by hedonistic desires that 
                no natural power could fulfill. The Emperor's Children are now a scattered Legion much like their counterparts the World Eaters, their unity devoured by their allegiance to Chaos.
                The Emperor's Children Legion now exists only as scattered, autonomous warbands located in the Eye of Terror who are dedicated to their own 
                pursuit of corrupt, hedonistic and usually murderous pleasures. The Chaos Space Marines of the Emperor's Children are known for possessing 
                outlandish mutations and surgical alterations as "gifts" from Slaanesh which are designed to make them more "perfect" in the eyes of their twisted patron.
                The Emperor's Children Traitor Legion exists for no other purpose but to exceed every extreme and to know every possible sensation. Its warriors are 
                entirely in the thrall of Slaanesh, the Dark Prince of Chaos, but once, the Legion of the Primarch Fulgrim strived for perfection in all they did, and were counted as 
                one of the most dedicated of all of the Emperor's followers.
