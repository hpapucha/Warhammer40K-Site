            <p>â€” The Emperor of Mankind</p>

            <p><strong>The Space Marines</strong> or Adeptus Astartes are foremost amongst the defenders of humanity, the greatest of the Emperor of Mankind's warriors. 
                They are barely human at all, but superhuman; having been made superior in all respects to a normal man by a harsh regime of genetic modification, psycho-conditioning and rigorous training.

                Space Marines are untouched by plague or any natural disease and can suffer wounds that would kill a lesser being several times over, 
                and live to fight again. Clad in ancient Power Armour and wielding the most potent weapons known to man, the Space Marines are terrifying 
                foes and their devotion to the Emperor and the Imperium of Man is unyielding. They are the God-Emperor's Angels of Death, and they know no fear.
            </p> 
            <figure>
            <img src="images/space_marines/space_marines3.jpg" alt="spacemarinesthree"></a>
            <figcaption>Ultramarines fighting Death Guard Chaos Legion.</figcaption>
        </figure>
            <p>The Astartes are physically stronger, far more resilient and often mentally far removed from the lot of most normal human beings. In the presence of the Astartes, most people feel a 
                combination of awe and fear, and many cultures on the more primitive worlds simply worship them outright as demigods or angels of the God-Emperor made flesh.
                They should feel so, for many Space Marines feel little compassion for those they have sometimes termed "mortals" in comparison to themselves, seeing 
                the very people they were created to protect as little more than obstacles to a more efficient eradication of the Imperium's enemies.
                This is an attitude sometimes taken by whole Chapters. They see normal humans as frail, weak creatures given to the follies of temptation, avarice, 
                greed, lust and cowardice -- all emotions they rarely feel, if ever.
            </p> 
                
            <p> They were intended not to lead humanity, but to defend it, sometimes even from itself. At the heart of that mission lies the 
                limitless compassion the Emperor extended to every man and woman in the galaxy when He willingly chose to condemn Himself to more 
                than 10,000 years of imprisonment within a dying prison of flesh for their sake.
                Potential Space Marines are usually, but not always, recruited from the worlds where a Chapter has established its fortress-monastery, although some 
                Chapters are known to recruit from a collection of different worlds in an area of space that they protect or frequent.Recruiting methods vary from Chapter to Chapter. 
                Some select their Neophytes from feral tribes roaming the surface of inhospitable worlds, while others draw upon eager volunteers who have been groomed from birth to become an Astartes.
                Still others watch and kidnap potential warriors, turning them into Astartes whether they will it or not. Whatever the method, all Space Marine Chapters 
                will only accept those who successfully pass the grueling initiation trials and prove themselves worthy of becoming a Space Marine.

        </figure>
            <p>There are approximately 1,000 Space Marine Chapters active in the Imperium of Man at any one time. One chapter has up to 1000 Space Marines.
                Since the opening of the Great Rift, these Chapters have been comprised of a mixture of traditional 
                Firstborn Space Marines and the even more enhanced Primaris Space Marines, or may contain only Primaris Marines.
                However, the exact population of Astartes in the galaxy remains far from exact and may fluctuate widely depending on the time period and the circumstances confronting the Imperium.
