                <h3 class="subhead">Loyalist Legion</h3>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>The Iron Hands</strong> are a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter and one of the original First Founding Space Marine Legions created from the gene-seed of their martyred Primarch, Ferrus Manus.
            </p> 
            <h1 class="display-2">Primarch Ferrus Manus</h1>
            <p>
             <strong>   Ferrus Manus</strong>, also known as "The Gorgon," was the Primarch of the Iron Hands Space Marine Legion, a master smith known for 
                creating weapons that were able to inspire awe in any who saw them, such as the sword he created for Fulgrim, Primarch of the Emperor's 
                Children Legion or the Bolter he crafted for Vulkan, the Primarch of the Salamanders Legion, said to have a barrel designed to look like the gaping mouth of a dragon.

            </figure>

            
            <p>   Ferrus' hands were covered in the metallic substance known as necrodermis and he needed no hammer or flame to create beauty through metallurgy, using only his 
                exceptionally powerful hands to mold and shape molten metal. Ferrus forged his closest bond with his brother Fulgrim, but this relationship ultimately ended in 
                tragedy after Fulgrim fell to Chaos during the Horus Heresy.
                During the Drop Site Massacre on the world of Istvaan V at the start of the Heresy, Fulgrim decapitated Ferrus with a daemonic sword, an action that ultimately 
                marked the point of no return on his path to becoming a Daemon Prince of the Chaos God Slaanesh.

            <p><strong>The Iron Hands</strong> are a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter and one of the original First Founding Space Marine Legions created from the gene-seed of their martyred Primarch, Ferrus Manus.
                Like the other Loyalist Astartes Legions, the Iron Hands would later be divided up after the Horus Heresy into multiple different Chapters, as required by the Codex Astartes, although one Chapter of the original Legion remained known as the Iron Hands and is described below.                
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>Although unwavering in their faith in the Emperor of Mankind and His dream of human unity as embodied in the Imperium of Man, the Iron Hands also believe that human flesh is weak and easily corruptible, and strive to replace their organic bodies with more "pure" bionic substitutes, thus closely emulating the faith of the Adeptus Mechanicus' Cult of the Machine.
            The Iron Hands were born as the Xth Legion of Space Marines, engineered by the Emperor of Mankind to bring His light to the long-lost human colony worlds scattered across the stars.
            Renowned for their pride, cold-hearted brutality and remorselessness in battle, the Iron Hands were among the most powerful and famed Space Marine Legions of the Great Crusade. 
            </p>

            <figcaption>Iron Hands fighting a Chaos Space Marine</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>It was during the Drop Site Massacre of Istvaan V that the Iron Hands, the Raven Guard and the Salamanders Legions were ambushed by the Traitors led by the 
                Warmaster Horus, and though the three Loyalist Legions fought with extraordinary valour, Ferrus Manus himself was lost, beheaded by Fulgrim's Slaaneshi daemonblade 
                which he had uncovered from the xenos world of Laeran.
                The Iron Hands were undone by their own hubris and the blade of the Traitor both, and paid a heavy price in the brutal slaying of their Primarch and the 
                near-crippling of their strength.               
                Though left as one of the Shattered Legions, the cold fury of the Iron Hands' bitter vengeance would afterwards be writ across the stars. While the Traitors 
                declared their Primarch dead upon the blasted wastes of Istvaan V, the current Iron Hands Chapter refuses to accept this, for the Primarch's body was never recovered. 
            </p> 

            <p>
        For over 10,000 Terran years, the Sons of Ferrus Manus have stoked their burning hatred, drawing strength from this inexhaustible well of rage as they await their lost Primarch's return.
        The unique identity of the Iron Hands is forged by their belief that all flesh is inherently weak, for it is subject to mortification, decay and temptation and is thus a weakness that must ultimately be purged if the Chapter's Astartes are to best serve the Emperor.
