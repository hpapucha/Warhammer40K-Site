                <h3 class="subhead">Traitor Legion</h3>
                <hr>
            <p><strong>The Emperor's Children</strong>, also sometimes known after their fall as the Lords of Profligacy, are a Traitor Legion of Chaos Space Marines who devote 
                themselves solely to the service of the Chaos God Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure, though they were originally the Imperium of Man's proud IIIrd Legion of Astartes
            </p> 
            <h1 class="display-2">Primarch Perturabo</h1>
            <figure>
            <img src="legions/fourth-iron-warriors/perturabo.jpg" alt="perturabo"></a>
            <figcaption>Perturabo heading to battle.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Perturabo, sometimes called the "Lord of Iron," "The Breaker" and "The Hammer of Olympia," is the Primarch of the Iron Warriors Traitor Legion, one of the 
                original twenty Space Marine Legions. Weaned on war and intrigue in the strife-ridden courts of his homeworld of Olympia, Perturabo was a grim warrior and 
                master of technological arcana who wielded logic and the mathematics of warfare as keenly as he did a blade and Bolter.

            </p>    
            <p>The Lord of Iron was taciturn to the point of insult, preferring to harbour his thoughts against the threat of treachery, even amongst his kin. 
                Few would call him friend, but none could fault his ability to wage a campaign and plot the most direct course to victory regardless of the cost 
                and despite the strain put on him and his IVth Legion during the long years of the Great Crusade. His word was as unbreakable as iron.

            </p> 
            <p>
                Unlike his brothers, many of whom embraced the Emperor of Mankind's Great Crusade with near-fanatical devotion, Perturabo thought of it simply as a 
                task that his sworn duty to the Emperor compelled him to pursue. His conquests were innumerable, but unremarked and unthanked, as his Iron Warriors 
                brought many worlds into the Imperium of Man, but he left behind him shattered planets on the brink of extinction by his brutal, if effective, strategies.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the tragic events of the Horus Heresy and his Legion's subsequent flight into the Eye of Terror, he has since ascended to Daemon Prince status by 
                the will of the Ruinous Powers and currently resides within the Eye of Terror on the Daemon World of Medrengard.

            <p>
                <strong>The Iron Warriors</strong>, who were originally the IVth Legion of Space Marines, specialised in the breaking of sieges and assaults on static fortifications, 
                which made them great rivals of the Imperial Fists Legion, said to construct the greatest static defences in the Imperium. It was this rivalry between the 
                Legions, and between their Primarchs Perturabo and the Imperial Fists' Rogal Dorn, that helped turn the Iron Warriors to Chaos.
            </p>

            <figcaption>Iron Warriors infiltrating a battleship.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Like the members of the Adeptus Mechanicus and the Loyalist Iron Hands Chapter, the Iron Warriors have a strong predilection for replacing parts of their 
                body with cybernetic enhancements. When struck with a mutational "gift" from the Ruinous Powers, most Iron Warriors simply cut off the mutated appendage, 
                if possible, and replace it with a mechanical one.
                The Iron Warriors were the Emperor's finest siege troops and their Primarch, Perturabo, was the equal of Rogal Dorn in the arts of fortification and strategy. 
                Yet, Perturabo felt himself side-lined by his brother Primarch, whose every proud boast was, to the master of the Iron Warriors, a barbed insult. When the Horus 
                Heresy came, it was perhaps inevitable that the two Primarchs should find themselves on opposite sides of the galactic civil war. 
            </p>

            <p>The Iron Warriors proved themselves amongst the most able siege troops in the Emperor's armies. Perturabo was possessed of a keen, cold, and calculating mind well-suited to the highly technical aspects of such a style of warfare. Furthermore, he was gifted with an affinity with advanced technology, and able to debate the finer points of the most esoteric arts with the highest placed Adepts of the Mechanicum. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                In the 41st Millennium, the Iron Warriors remain a constant thorn in the side of the Emperor's realm. From their Daemon World of Medrengard in the Eye of Terror, Iron Warriors warbands under the command of various Warsmiths often strike out in search of new spoils and technology to enhance their own capabilities.
                The Iron Warriors work closely with the Hereteks of the Dark Mechanicum and have proven capable of unleashing fiendishly potent new Daemon Engines upon the servants of the Imperium.
