            <p><strong>The Word Bearers</strong> are one of the nine First Founding Space Marine Legions that betrayed the Emperor of Mankind during the Horus Heresy. 
                They became Chaos Space Marines, their allegiance pledged to their Daemon Primarch Lorgar and to Chaos Undivided. The Word Bearers were 
                also the first Space Marine Legion to be corrupted by the Ruinous Powers of Chaos many Terran decades before their counterparts turned to the Dark Gods.

            <p><strong>Lorgar</strong>, also once called Lorgar Aurelian and the Urizen (Colchisian for "wisest of the wise") before the Horus Heresy, is a Daemon

            Always determined to uplift humanity through a deep belief in the divine, once the Emperor of Mankind rejected his attempts at worship, 
            Lorgar discovered new gods more worthy of his devotion, the Ruinous Powers of Chaos, during his infamous Pilgrimage.
            He was the first Primarch of the Space Marine Legions to fall to the corruption of Chaos before the Horus Heresy and it was he who ordered the corruption of the Warmaster Horus.
            He and his large Traitor Legion of Word Bearers Chaos Space Marines can today be found on the Daemon World of Sicarus within the Eye of Terror.

                <strong>The Word Bearers</strong> are one of the nine First Founding Space Marine Legions that betrayed the Emperor of Mankind during the Horus Heresy. 
                They became Chaos Space Marines, their allegiance pledged to their Daemon Primarch Lorgar and to Chaos Undivided. The Word Bearers were 
                also the first Space Marine Legion to be corrupted by the Ruinous Powers of Chaos many Terran decades before their counterparts turned to the Dark Gods.

            <figcaption>Word Bearer Space Marine during battle. </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Through their actions they corrupted the Warmaster Horus and brought on the terrible galactic civil war of the Horus Heresy in all its savagery. Today 
                they bend all their considerable efforts towards the overthrow of the "Corpse Emperor" in the Long War and spreading the "truth" of Chaos to all Mankind.
                In the years before the return of Lorgar and the discovery of his homeworld of Colchis by the expanding fleets of the Imperium in 857.M30, the XVIIth 
                Legion was known amongst the vast hosts of the Great Crusade by designations other than the "Word Bearers." The Emperor named them the "Imperial Heralds" 
                at their inception, an elegant title that spoke of the grand purpose for which they had been created, whilst their fellow Astartes warriors named them the 
                "Iconoclasts," a more brutal appellation coined in appreciation of the zeal with which they cast down the idolatrous temples and cultic strongholds of Old Night.

            <figcaption>Corrupted Word Bearer.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>After the Legion was reunited with its lost Primarch, he renamed the XVIIth Legion the Word Bearers, which was in line with his belief that the Emperor of 
                Mankind was the divine saviour of humanity. At present, the Word Bearers' greatest foes amongst the servants of the Emperor are the Ultramarines and their 
                Successor Chapters, who the Word Bearers have hated and seen as rivals since the time of the Great Crusade.
                
            </p> 

            <p>
                The Word Bearers are the scions of the Primarch Lorgar, the Dark Apostle of Chaos and first of the Primarchs to be corrupted by the Ruinous Powers. The Word 
                Bearers sought a being worthy of their veneration, but when the Emperor denounced such practises during the Great Crusade, they turned to the Warp and the Powers of Chaos within.
